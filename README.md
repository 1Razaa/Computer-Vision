## images.py Script

The `images.py` script is written in Python and uses the OpenCV library to load and display an image from the `Images` folder. When executed, the script opens the image in a separate window, where it can be viewed.

To run the script, make sure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it via pip:


### How it works:
1. It reads the image using `cv2.imread()`.
2. It displays the image in a window using `cv2.imshow()`.
3. The window remains open until any key is pressed.

### Images

The `Images` folder contains images that are used by the `images.py` script. These images can be any format supported by OpenCV (e.g., .jpg, .png).
